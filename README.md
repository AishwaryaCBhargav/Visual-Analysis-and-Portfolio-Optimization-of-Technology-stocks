# Visual-Analysis-and-Portfolio-Optimization-of-Technology-stocks

This is one of my courseworks submitted to complete my MSc in data Science at City, University of London.



The main aim of this study is to build a portfolio of FAANG stocks with optimal investment
weightage for each stock, so as to minimise the risk and maximize the returns.

In process of achieving this aim, following questions/objectives will be answered/fulfilled:
i. What is the trend in stock prices of FAANG stocks over the years?
ii. Did the Great Recession of 2008-09 have same effect on all the 5 stocks?
iii. What is the return and risk associated with investing in each of FAANG stocks?
iv. What are the cumulative returns given by the stocks?
v. Do these stocks together form a safe (low risk) portfolio?
vi. How do the FAANG stocks compare with other stocks of stock market, on the basis
of risk and return associated with each stock?
vii. To plot the Efficient Frontier representing the best portfolio with optimal weightage
of each stock and maximum Sharpe ratio (Return/Risk).
